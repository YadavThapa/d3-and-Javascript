# Project overview
Dana wants to create and dynamic and intereactive web page for UFO sightings using Javascript and D3 library. She wants to add design multiple search criteria and event listen features in the tabble when the input are changed.

# Objectives
The main objective of this project is to help Dana to create web-pages using Java Script and D3 library. It allows her to see and select large chunck of JSON files with multiple search criteria. It will save her time to understand the UFO information in a just few clicks. 

# Results
D3.js or only D3 (Data Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library used for manipulating documents based on data (data-driven approach to DOM manipulation) and for making dynamic and interactive data visualizations. It works great with commonly used standards like HTML, CSS and SVG. Manipulating SVG with D3 isnâ€™t different than manipulating any other DOM element (ok, we still should take care that there are some differences between HTML and SVG elements, e.g. in some CSS properties like background vs fill or border vs stroke, etc.)

# Summary
We are able to make dynamic table with multiple search criteria with the help of Java Script D3-library and event listener feaures. This enabled feature helps Dana to filter table in a very efficienct way. Any changes, filters or updates on the tables will immidiately reflect on the table and help her to understand the information quickly. 

1. Since D3 is lightweight, and works directly with web standards, it is extremely fast and works well with large datasets.
2. D3 does not provide any specific feature, so it gives you complete control over your visualization to customize it the way we want.
3. The main benefits of D3.js are its rich toolset for data-driven visuals, an active community for easy access to information, and its versatility and compatibility to compared to other JavaScript-based apps.


# Recommendation
1. When we are call the Java Script file , the order of the files should be placed properly. Orelse the changes on effect does not seem effective.
2. All kind of web pages cannot be deployed at github. We can diploy the static web pages with fron end application which are not connected with any databases. To deploy the dynamic web- pages we need to be connected with servers.
